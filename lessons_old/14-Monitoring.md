### Monitoring Apps

### Production Monitoring 

If your app is deployed on CaaS, you get basic monitoring of your app's resource utilization by default. The platform will provide a real-time monitoring dashboard built using SysDig, which is still in a POC stage. 

If you need more app performance monitoring capabilities than the basic monitoring provided by the platform, you can connect your app to Ford's Dynatrace instance for a cost. You can sign up on the [Dynatrace team website](https://it1.spt.ford.com/sites/L1POE/Public/SitePages/Dynatrace.aspx).

### Grafana

![Grafana](https://github.ford.com/DevEnablement/caas-workshop/blob/master/images/monitoring.png)

Grafana is a basic, out of the box monitoring tool. It allows teams to monitor their CPU and memory utilization. Teams can view the current or most recently running pods and see the CPU and memory usage over time. 

### SysDig

SysDig is a monitoring tool that will allow for basic monitoring and alerting. The following is a list of some features and monitoring it provides: 

- Minor application process monitoring 
- Container level monitoring 
- Pod level monitoring 
- Compilation of all events 
- Ability to create alerts on any metric and event 
- File System usage

The tool is still in the POC stage and will be available in production in Q4. 

### Dynatrace

Dynatrace is available in production - but not on a system wide level. It will be the application team's responsibility to add the Dynatrace agent to the team's Dockerfile. However, the additions are relatively simple add-ons to any existing Dockerfile. When the final implementation is decided on by the Dynatrace team, this configuration will be made public for app teams to use. 

<!--
> NOTE: This implementation is subject to change 

#### Dockerfile Changes

Open Dockerfile-2 located in `springboot/image` for your own reference. We will review the additions that you can simply add to your Dockerfiles to include a Dyntrace agent in your containers. 

```Dockerfile
FROM registry.redhat.io/rhscl/python-27-rhel7 AS builder
ARG DT_API_URL="https://wwwqa.dynatrace.ford.com/e/114d327e-ea9d-46cc-92d3-3967eaedacde/api/"
ARG DT_API_TOKEN="YOUR_TOKEN_HERE"
ARG DT_ONEAGENT_OPTIONS="flavor=default&include=java"
ENV DT_HOME="/opt/dynatrace/oneagent"
USER root
RUN mkdir -p "$DT_HOME" && \
    wget --no-check-certificate -O "$DT_HOME/oneagent.zip" "$DT_API_URL/v1/deployment/installer/agent/unix/paas/latest?Api-Token=$DT_API_TOKEN&$DT_ONEAGENT_OPTIONS" && \
    unzip -d "$DT_HOME" "$DT_HOME/oneagent.zip" && \
    rm "$DT_HOME/oneagent.zip"
```

The first part of the Dockerfile sets arguments and environment variables for the Dynatrace URL, token, options, and home directory. The `RUN` step uses all these variables to make a directory in which to play the Dynatrace agent and unzip it. 

The rest of the Dockerfile is the Dockerfile is nearly the same as our previous Dockerfile, with another `FROM` statement. This is known as a [multi-stage build](https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/multistage-build/). Each `FROM` statement can use a different base. Below is the rest of the Dockerfile. 

```Dockerfile
FROM registry.redhat.io/redhat-openjdk-18/openjdk18-openshift
EXPOSE 8080
COPY --from=builder /opt/dynatrace/oneagent /opt/dynatrace/oneagent #<--New Line
RUN sh /opt/dynatrace/oneagent/dynatrace-agent64.sh                 #<--New Line
ARG JAR_FILE=../build/libs/devenablement-service-helloworld.jar     
ADD ${JAR_FILE} devenablement-service-helloworld.jar
USER root                                                           #<--New Line
ENTRYPOINT ["java","-Djava.security.egd=file:/dev/./urandom","-jar","devenablement-service-helloworld.jar"]
```

In the second stage of our multi-stage build, we have most of the same Dockerfile as we did previously. There are 3 changes to include Dynatrace. 

These additions to your Dockerfile will enable your pods to send data to Dynatrace.
