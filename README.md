This workshop will provide instructions to build application container images, then deploying these images to the CaaS platfom. Workshop participants will experience deploying a sample application to a local CaaS environment on their own workstation. In doing so, participants will learn how they can take the applications they build and deploy to Ford's CaaS platform.

# Agenda

#### Lesson 1, App Container Images
- Setting up the CaaS localdev environment on your workstation.
- Building your first app container image.
- Understanding Ford's container image registry.

#### Lesson 2, Running Apps in CaaS
- Running the app container images built in the last lesson in Openshift.
- Managing app container resources.

#### Lesson 3, Advanced Topics
- Monitoring app performance.
- Utilizing persistent storage options.
- Configuring vanity URLs and TLS security.
- Using Jenkins and other CI/CD tools.

# Pre-requisites and Equipment
- Working knowledge of git and github (basic stuff like cloning repos).
- Your own developer-class laptop with minimal 4 CPU cores and 8GB of RAM. An underpowered laptop that is used mostly for checking email WILL NOT WORK.

Course content is targeted for a Windows environment using Git Bash for Windows or other Bash terminal emulator. If you have a Mac and are a wiz with it, then come on. Just be aware that the instructor will not be able to answer Mac-specific questions, so you'll be on your own to translate commands from Windows to Mac and troubleshoot your own issues if things go off the rails.

# Schedule

The workshop is currently under development. It will be available in May 2019. Sign-up details and associated costs will be released at that time.
