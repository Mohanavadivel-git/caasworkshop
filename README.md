## Deploying Apps to Ford's CaaS Platform

This is a hands-on, training workshop to get application development teams started in Ford's Container as a Service platform.

This workshop will provide instructions to build application container images, then deploying these images to the CaaS platform. Workshop participants will experience deploying a sample application to a local CaaS environment on their own workstation. In doing so, participants will learn how they can take the applications they build and deploy to Ford's CaaS platform.

## Pre-requisites and Equipment
- Your own developer-class laptop with minimal 4 CPU cores and 8GB of RAM. An underpowered laptop that is used mostly for checking email WILL NOT WORK.
- Install the required software on your laptop prior to class. [Instructions](workstation-setup.md) will be sent out to registered attendees.
- Basic knowledge of command line and git/github. Simple stuff like cloning repos, moving files, etc...

Course content is targeted for a Windows environment using Git Bash for Windows or other Bash terminal emulator. If you have a Mac and are a wiz with it, then come on. Just be aware that the instructor will not be able to answer Mac-specific questions, so you'll be on your own to translate commands from Windows to Mac and troubleshoot your own issues if things go off the rails.

## Schedule

The workshop is offered once per month. The duration is two 4-hour sessions offered typically on two consecutive days. It is currently offered for no charge.
