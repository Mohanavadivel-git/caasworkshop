<!---
If you get an error like, "no such host" or "couldn't resolve host", the issue is likely with the name resolution of `console.oc.local`. The localdev installation runs a local DNS service to provide name resolution for the `oc.local` domain. Sometimes, you will need to wait a bit longer for the DNS service to start, or manually flush your DNS cache with `ipconfig /flushdns` on Windows (or escape the fwd slash in Git Bash like `ipconfig //flushdns`).
