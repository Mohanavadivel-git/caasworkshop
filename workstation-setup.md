# Workstation Setup and Homework
---

Before attending the workshop, you must pre-install some software on your laptop or workstation. You will likely be on wireless during the workshop, and the initial installation and setup of these packages will take hours if performed over wireless. So please install ahead of time to avoid wasting class time.

<!--
### Install Software on Workstation
- `oc` CLI
- Text editor of your choice, such as Notepad++, Eclipse, IntelliJ, [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), etc...
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
  - Set up your SSH keys so that you can clone repos. See the [Github Sharepoint Site](https://it2.spt.ford.com/sites/FCAutomatedTesting/Pages/GitHub.aspx) for guides on how to setup Github and get the Github Desktop application
  -->

### JDK 8 

To build the springboot application, you will need JDK 8 installed on your machine. 

1. Download the all-in-one software distributions package [here](https://00000-javacoe-dev-ns01.s3-object.ford.com:9021/jcoe/distros/ford.zip)
2. Unzip the contents into `C:\ford`
3. Navigate to that unzipped direction and go to the `jdk` folder
4. Either within the `jdk` or folder or within the `ibm` folder, there will be a `ibm-jdk8u151-b12.zip` file
5. Extract the contents of that zip into the current directory. 
6. Set your `JAVA_HOME` environment variable to point the path of the `ibm-jdk8u151-b12` folder

### Samples Repository

1. The CaaS team maintains a repository of sample apps that will run on CaaS. You will clone this repo locally, and then go through the process of building a container image with one of the sample apps.

2. Navigate to any workspace directory of your choosing. 

```bash
cd ~/workspace
```

3. Clone the samples repository. If you have the Github desktop application, you can use that to clone the repository. 

```bash
git clone git@github.ford.com:JPOTTE46/samples.git      # Using SSH
git clone https://github.ford.com/JPOTTE46/samples.git  # Using HTTPS
```

### OC CLI

To deploy objects into Openshift, you will need the `oc` CLI. 

1. Go to https://files.caas.ford.com:9443/oc-cli/latest/ and click on the proper download for your operating system. 
2. Extract the contents of the `.zip` to a permanent location (such as C:/Users/<YOUR_CDSID>)
3. Add the path to the `oc` binary to your system's path.
  - Windows
    1. Go to start, type `Path`, and click `Edit the System Environment Variables`
    2. Click the `Environment Variables` button. 
    3. In the `System Variables` section, find the variable called `Path` and double click it. 
    4. Click `New` and paste the location to the `oc` binary. 
  - Mac: 

You're all set and ready for the workshop!

Additionally, you will get much more out of the class if you come in with a high-level understanding of Containers and Kubernetes. Please take 20 minutes to review these videos prior to class.

- [What is a Container?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnJ7qX9fkcU&t=969s) You only need to watch up to 12:30. The remainder of video is specific Docker which is not directly relevant to CaaS.
